# Microsoft-Drawing-in-Python
Creating a whiteboard in python
Allows user to run a whiteboard on their computer sourcing from Python's game-based libraryâ€”pygame. 

Through this outside project, I challenged myself to learn outside knowledge as well as applying what I've learned in my Introduction to Python course. I plan to update this project and improve as well as add more functions to it.
